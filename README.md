Dominion-AI
===========

AI Player for Dominion created by Monisha White and Nolan Walsh as a Final Project for CS221 at Stanford

As the final project for CS221: Artificial Intelligence Principles and Techniques, we created a AI Dominion Player. We modelled the game of Dominion as a Markov Decision Process and created a player that can beat even reasonably skilled human players after training against itself.
